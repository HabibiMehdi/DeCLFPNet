| 2016 | [Continuous Force Decoding from Local Field Potentials of the Primary Motor Cortex in Freely Moving Rats](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep35238) | This paper presents a method for decoding continuous force from local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in the primary motor cortex of freely moving rats. It demonstrates the feasibility of decoding motor signals in a naturalistic setting. |
| 2019 | [Nonlinear sparse partial least squares: an investigation of the effect of nonlinearity and sparsity on the decoding of intracranial data](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ab5d47) | This work explores how nonlinearity and sparsity in sparse partial least squares models influence the decoding accuracy of intracranial neural data. |
| 2020 | [State-based decoding of force signals from multi-channel local field potentials](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9177005) | This paper proposes a state-based approach for decoding force signals using multi-channel local field potentials, achieving robust decoding accuracy. |
